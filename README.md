# Walking Route Optimization

## Introduction
Tourists visiting downtown Toronto often face chal-
lenges in planning efficient walking routes that cover major
attractions while minimizing travel time and effort. This project addresses the problem of walking route optimization by
employing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with Depth-
First Search (DFS) to determine the optimal route and ensure
a seamless return to the starting point. The proposed approach
incorporates bio-inspired optimization principles to tackle the
complex nature of the problem.

## Libraries and Environment Setup

The following libraries are essential for this project:
- `osmnx`: For geographic data and street network analysis.
- `shapely` and `geopandas`: For geometric operations.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing street networks.
- `networkx`: For graph-based route computation.
